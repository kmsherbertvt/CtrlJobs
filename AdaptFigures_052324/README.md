# Adapt Figures

This project is meant for nothing but generating consistent plots for a ctrl-ADAPT-VQE paper.
Those data are distributed over two different projects (one for square pulses and one for modal pulses),
    so loading both in the same script requires a separate environment.

Source code here just facilitates consistent styles when generating plots,
    but everything is super modular so it is super easy to customize plots still.
